TODO LIST

Major:

   * hypergraphs
   * hyperarchical graphs support
   * list-string storage optimization (values replaced by corresponding idx)
   * GEXF 1.0 export (Gephi 0.6)
   * memory optimization (strings replaced by their real type like int) ; create a wrapper to access data?

Minor:
   * Iterators for every set<> returned by methods for Java binding compatibility
   * Logger class for info(), warn() and err() messages
